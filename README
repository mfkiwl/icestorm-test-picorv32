Playing with picorv32 on the iCE40-HX8K

# dnf install icestorm arachne-pnr yosys emacs-verilog-mode

You must also build cross-gcc for riscv32, see:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1492341#c5

$ git submodule init
$ make
$ [sudo] make prog

If the chip is programmed correctly, all 8 LEDs will flash on and
off about once a second.

You can connect to the serial port using:

$ screen /dev/ttyUSB1 115200

and if you hit ENTER you should get the logo and menu (see firmware.c).
